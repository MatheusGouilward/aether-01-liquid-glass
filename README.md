# Aether 01 — Liquid Glass Design System

Aether 01 is a structured experimental project focused on building a production-grade Design System from zero using AI-assisted workflows.

**Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Figma Variables, Claude Code → Figma, Storybook (planned).

**Objective:** Evaluate how AI accelerates the architecture, tokenization, theming, and scalability of a Liquid Glass Design System while maintaining enterprise-level consistency.
