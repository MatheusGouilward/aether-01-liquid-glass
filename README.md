# Aether 01 — Liquid Glass Design System

Aether 01 is an experimental AI-augmented Design System built from scratch to explore how far a single designer can architect a robust, reusable system using Claude Code and Figma.

**Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Storybook (planned), Figma Variables, Claude Code → Figma.

**Objective:** Measure speed, architectural consistency, and scalability when building a production-ready Liquid Glass Design System end-to-end as a solo builder.

**Figma File:** [[Insert Figma link here](https://www.figma.com/design/GcCdFbtV5d7sVHuwzvTngQ/Aether-01-%E2%80%94-Design-System--Liquid-Glass-?node-id=12-762&t=0R8JLZyzjsqG7rQC-1)]

**Status:** Week 1 — Step 1 (Architecture & Foundations Setup)
